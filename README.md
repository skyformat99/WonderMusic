### The front-end part

The front-end part is mainly built by jQuery,Sass and Gulp, by using the AJAX to get the resources from my server. by using the HTML5 audio API to I also add some CSS3 animation for the transition experience.

### The back-end part

The back-end part is built by PHP, all these efforts on the back-end part is in order to a unified JSON format and AJAX port. In order to improve the experience, the CORS is also supported.
Now I release the API out, welcome you communicate with me.
